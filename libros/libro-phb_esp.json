						"El objetivo del juego de rol de Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) es contar historias en mundos de espada y brujería. Al igual que los juegos de niños en los que éstos fingen ser personajes ficticios, como el indio y vaqueros, el motor de D&D es la imaginación: visualizar el imponente castillo bajo el tormentoso cielo nocturno e imaginar cómo un aventurero de fantasía podría reaccionar a los desafíos que la escena le plantea.",

								"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} Tras atravesar los ásperos picos, el camino gira bruscamente hacia el este y el Castillo Ravenloft se yergue ante vosotros. Las torres desmoronadas de una fortaleza de piedra mantienen una guardia silenciosa sobre el acceso. Parecen puestos de vigilancia abandonados. Tras ellos se abre un ancho abismo cuyo fondo se pierde entre la niebla. Un puente levadizo bajado cruza el abismo, conduciendo a una entrada en forma de arco que lleva al patio del castillo. El viento hace chirriar las cadenas del puente levadizo, cuyos eslabones de hierro oxidado luchan por aguantar el peso del mismo. Gárgolas de piedra sonríen espantosamente y os observan con sus cuencas vacías desde la parte superior de las altas y fuertes murallas. Un podrido rastrillo de madera, verde de musgo, está levantado en el túnel de entrada. Tras él, las puertas principales del Castillo Ravenloft se encuentran abiertas, surgiendo de ellas una luz cálida e intensa que se escapa hacia el patio.",

Todo es posible, pero los dados hacen que ciertos resultados sean más probables que otros.",

						"Trabajando juntos, el grupo podría explorar una oscura mazmorra, una ciudad en ruinas, un castillo encantado, un templo perdido en las profundidades de la selva o una caverna llena de lava bajo una misteriosa montaña. Los aventureros pueden resolver acertijos, hablar con otros personajes, luchar contra monstruos fantásticos y descubrir fabulosos objetos mágicos y otros tesoros.",
						"Un jugador asume el papel del Dungeon Master (DM, Señor de la Mazmorra en español): el narrador principal y árbitro del juego.",

El DM podría describir la entrada al Castillo Ravenloft y los jugadores elegir qué quieren que hagan sus aventureros. ¿Cruzarán el deteriorado puente levadizo? ¿Se atarán entre sí con unas cuerdas para minimizar la posibilidad de que alguno se caiga si el puente cede? ¿O lanzarán un conjuro que les transporte al otro lado del abismo? Entonces el DM determinará el resultado de las acciones de los aventureros y describirá lo que estos experimentan. D&D es un juego infinitamente flexible, ya que el DM puede improvisar para responder a cualquier cosa que los aventureros intenten hacer, de manera que cada aventura sea emocionante e impredecible.",

Muchas de las personas que juegan mantienen sus campañas vivas durante meses o años, quedando con sus amigos casi cada semana para continuar con la historia donde la dejaron. Los aventureros se vuelven más poderosos conforme la campaña avanza. Cada monstruo derrotado, cada aventura terminada y cada tesoro recuperado no solo contribuyen a avanzar en la historia, sino que también dotan a los aventureros de nuevas capacidades. Este aumento de poder se refleja en el nivel de un personaje.",
						"En una partida de Dungeons & Dragons no se gana ni se pierde. O, al menos, no tal y como se entienden estos términos normalmente. El DM y los jugadores crean juntos una emocionante historia, protagonizada por aguerridos aventureros que se enfrentan a peligros mortales. En ocasiones, un personaje podría sufrir un espeluznante final, despedazado por feroces monstruos o liquidado por un perverso villano. Aun así, los demás aventureros pueden buscar una magia lo bastante poderosa como para resucitar a su compañero caído, o tal vez el jugador decida jugar con un personaje nuevo. Es posible que el grupo fracase en su intento de terminar una aventura con éxito, pero si os lo habéis pasado bien y habéis creado una historia memorable, todos habréis ganado.",

Las leyendas de ambientaciones como los Reinos Olvidados, Dragonlance, Falcongris, Sol Oscuro, Mystara y Eberron están entretejidas en la estructura del multiverso. Junto a estos mundos se hallan cientos de miles más; los creados por generaciones de jugadores de D&D para sus propias partidas. Además, podrás añadir un mundo de creación propia a la riqueza del multiverso.",
								"Todos estos mundos comparten ciertas características, pero cada uno se diferencia por su historia y cultura propias, sus monstruos y razas específicos, sus antiguas mazmorras y sus tortuosos villanos. Algunas razas poseen características inusuales en ciertos mundos. Los medianos de la ambientación del Sol Oscuro, por poner un ejemplo, son caníbales que viven en la selva, mientras que los elfos son nómadas del desierto. Unos mundos cuentan con razas desconocidas en otras ambientaciones, como los forjados de Eberron; solados creados y dotados de vida para luchar en la Última Guerra. En cambio, otros están dominados por una única historia fundamental, como la Guerra de la Lanza, el centro de la ambientación Dragonlance. Sin embargo, todos ellos son mundos de D&D, por lo que puedes usar las reglas de este libro para crear un personaje y jugar en cualquiera de ellos.",
								"Tu DM podría situar su campaña en uno de estos mundos o en otro de su propia cosecha. Como existe tanta diversidad entre los mundos de D&D, deberás preguntar a tu Dungeon Master si usaréis alguna regla casera que afecte al juego. Al fin y al cabo, el DM es la autoridad máxima en vuestra campaña y su ambientación, aunque se trate de un mundo publicado."

El DM describe la situación.} El DM explica a los jugadores donde se encuentran sus aventureros y detalla los alrededores, para así darles oportunidad de hacerse una composición de lugar y decidir qué hacer. Un caso concreto podría ser señalar cuántas puertas tiene una habitación, que hay en la mesa, quien está en la taberna, y así.",
								"{@b 2. Los jugadores describen lo que hacen.} A veces un jugador hablará por todo el grupo. Por ejemplo: “Saldremos por la puerta este”. En otras ocasiones, cada aventurero hará una cosa distinta. Así uno podría buscar un cofre mientras otro examina el símbolo esotérico grabado en un muro y un tercero monta guardia para evitar que les sorprendan monstruos. Los jugadores no tienen por qué turnarse, pero el DM debe escucharlos a todos y decidir qué sucede en cada caso.",

Si un aventurero quiere caminar hasta el otro lado de la habitación y abrir una puerta, el DM simplemente dirá que la puerta se abre y describirá lo que hay tras ella. No obstante, quizá la puerta está cerrada, el suelo esconde una trampa mortal o cualquier otra circunstancia haga que llevar acá o se proponía sea difícil. En estos casos, el DM decidirá lo que sucede, recurriendo habitualmente a la tirada de un dado para dilucidar el resultado de la acción.",

								"En muchas ocasiones las acciones se desarrollan únicamente en la imaginación, tanto de los jugadores como del DM, apoyándose en las descripciones de la escena que hace este. A algunos Dungeon Master les gusta recurrir a música, ilustraciones o efectos de sonido para crear ambiente, y hay tanto jugadores como DM que usan diferentes tonos de voz al hablar para distinguir entre varios aventureros, monstruos y otros personajes que interpreten durante la partida. En ocasiones concretas, el DM podría incluso desplegar un mapa y utilizar contadores o miniaturas para representar a las criaturas que forman parte de una escena, de modo que los jugadores puedan ubicarse más fácilmente.",

Algunos dados de diez caras tienen grabadas directamente las decenas (00, 10, 20 y así sucesivamente), lo que hace más fácil distinguir que dado representa cada dígito. Usando un dado de este tipo, un 70 y un 1 es un 71, y un 00 y un 0 es un 100.",

Para la tirada de 1d2, lanza cualquier dado; si sale impar el resultado será 1, y si sale par 2.

Sea como fuere, toda aventura se desarrolla en una ambientación fantástica como una mazmorra subterránea, un castillo derruido, la naturaleza o la bulliciosa ciudad. En ella aparece un rico elenco de personajes: los aventureros creados y controlados por el resto de los jugadores y los personajes no jugadores (PNJ). Estos últimos pueden ser patrones, aliados, enemigos, siervos o simplemente extras para dar color a la aventura. Muchas veces, uno de estos PNJ será el villano cuyos planes son la causa de la aventura.",

No obstante, a veces deberán dialogar con criaturas (o incluso objetos mágicos) para alcanzar sus objetivos. También habrá momentos en los que los personajes deberán resolver un acertijo, superar un obstáculo, encontrar un objeto escondido o percatarse de lo que está ocurriendo en realidad. Y, mientras sucede todo esto, los aventureros explorarán el mundo, decidiendo el destino de sus viajes y que hacer a continuación.",

El combate es la parte más fuertemente estructurada de una sesión de D&D y en él las criaturas se turnan para que así todos tengan la oportunidad de actuar. No obstante, incluso en media de una encarnizada batalla, aún hay espacio para que los aventureros intenten las proezas más alocadas que se les ocurran (como bajar surfeando sobre un escudo un tramo de escaleras), examinar su entorno (quizá tirando de esa misteriosa palanca) o interaccionar con otras criaturas, ya sean aliados, enemigos u observadores neutrales."

Es posible que la gente normal presencie muestras de magia con cierta frecuencia, pero suelen ser efectos menores: un monstruo, una plegaria que recibe respuesta o un mago que camina protegido por su guardián escudo.",

Sin el inspirador apoyo de la magia de bardos y clérigos, los guerreros se verán sobrepasados por sus enemigos más poderosos. Sin el impresionante poder mágico y la versatilidad de los magos y los druidas, las amenazas serían diez veces más mortales.",
										"La magia también es el arma favorita de los villanos. Muchos aventureros se ven arrastrados por las maquinaciones de taumaturgos empecinados en utilizar sus poderes para hacer el mal. El líder de una secta que busca despertar a un dios que duerme bajo las aguas, la bruja que secuestra a jóvenes para robarles su vigor, el mago enloquecido que persigue dotar a un ejército de autómatas de una mera semblanza de vida y el dragón que se encuentra tras un ritual que le permitirá convertirse en un dios de la destrucción son solo algunos ejemplos de las amenazas de naturaleza mágica a las que podrían enfrentarse los aventureros. ¡Pero armadas con sus propios poderes mágicos en forma de conjuros y objetos mágicos, los personajes tienen la oportunidad de vencer!"

Puedes probar a hacer un personaje de una de esas razas. ¿Quieres que tu personaje sea el aventurero más duro de la mesa? Valora la posibilidad de crear un bárbaro o un paladín. Si no sabes por dónde empezar, echa un vistazo a las ilustraciones de este libro hasta que encuentres algo que te llame la atención.",

A veces estos atributos se compenetran bien con las capacidades de ciertas clases (ver el paso 2). Por ejemplo, los atributos raciales de los medianos pies ligeros les convierten en pícaros excepcionales y los altos elfos tienden a ser magos poderosos. Aunque jugar desafiando los arquetipos también puede ser divertido. Los paladines semiorcos y los magos enanos de las montañas, por ejemplo, suelen ser personajes inusuales pero memorables.",

Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion.

From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin\u2014he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt.

The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.",

								"In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.",
								"The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge."

Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.",
								"Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel\u2014to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon\u2014makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves."

A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.",

				"Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in {@skill Athletics}, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in {@skill Athletics}, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ({@skill Intimidation}) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma."
