						"El objetivo del juego de rol de Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) es contar historias en mundos de espada y brujería. Al igual que los juegos de niños en los que éstos fingen ser personajes ficticios, como el indio y vaqueros, el motor de D&D es la imaginación: visualizar el imponente castillo bajo el tormentoso cielo nocturno e imaginar cómo un aventurero de fantasía podría reaccionar a los desafíos que la escena le plantea.",

								"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} Tras atravesar los ásperos picos, el camino gira bruscamente hacia el este y el Castillo Ravenloft se yergue ante vosotros. Las torres desmoronadas de una fortaleza de piedra mantienen una guardia silenciosa sobre el acceso. Parecen puestos de vigilancia abandonados. Tras ellos se abre un ancho abismo cuyo fondo se pierde entre la niebla. Un puente levadizo bajado cruza el abismo, conduciendo a una entrada en forma de arco que lleva al patio del castillo. El viento hace chirriar las cadenas del puente levadizo, cuyos eslabones de hierro oxidado luchan por aguantar el peso del mismo. Gárgolas de piedra sonríen espantosamente y os observan con sus cuencas vacías desde la parte superior de las altas y fuertes murallas. Un podrido rastrillo de madera, verde de musgo, está levantado en el túnel de entrada. Tras él, las puertas principales del Castillo Ravenloft se encuentran abiertas, surgiendo de ellas una luz cálida e intensa que se escapa hacia el patio.",
								"{@b Gabriel (jugando como Gareth):} Quiero examinar las gárgolas. Presiento que no son simples estatuas.",

						"A diferencia de los juegos de imaginación de los niños, D&D dota de estructura a las historias y proporciona un método para determinar las consecuencias de las acciones de los aventureros. Los jugadores tiran dados para averiguar si sus personajes aciertan o fallan en sus ataques, si consiguen escalar un precipicio, esquivar el impacto de un relámpago mágico o llevar a cabo cualquier otra tarea que implique peligro. Todo es posible, pero los dados hacen que ciertos resultados sean más probables que otros.",

						"En una partida de Dungeons & Dragons cada jugador crea un aventurero (también llamado personaje) y forma equipo con otros aventureros (controlados por amigos).",
						"Trabajando juntos, el grupo podría explorar una oscura mazmorra, una ciudad en ruinas, un castillo encantado, un templo perdido en las profundidades de la selva o una caverna llena de lava bajo una misteriosa montaña. Los aventureros pueden resolver acertijos, hablar con otros personajes, luchar contra monstruos fantásticos y descubrir fabulosos objetos mágicos y otros tesoros.",
						"Un jugador asume el papel del Dungeon Master (DM, Señor de la Mazmorra en español): el narrador principal y árbitro del juego.",
						"El DM crea aventuras para los personajes, que se enfrentan a las dificultades y deciden qué caminos explorar. El DM podría describir la entrada al Castillo Ravenloft y los jugadores elegir qué quieren que hagan sus aventureros. ¿Cruzarán el deteriorado puente levadizo? ¿Se atarán entre sí con unas cuerdas para minimizar la posibilidad de que alguno se caiga si el puente cede? ¿O lanzarán un conjuro que les transporte al otro lado del abismo? Entonces el DM determinará el resultado de las acciones de los aventureros y describirá lo que estos experimentan. D&D es un juego infinitamente flexible, ya que el DM puede improvisar para responder a cualquier cosa que los aventureros intenten hacer, de manera que cada aventura sea emocionante e impredecible.",
						"El juego no tiene un final propiamente dicho; cuando una trama o misión concluye le sigue otra, de modo que se crea una historia continua llamada campaña. Muchas de las personas que juegan mantienen sus campañas vivas durante meses o años, quedando con sus amigos casi cada semana para continuar con la historia donde la dejaron. Los aventureros se vuelven más poderosos conforme la campaña avanza. Cada monstruo derrotado, cada aventura terminada y cada tesoro recuperado no solo contribuyen a avanzar en la historia, sino que también dotan a los aventureros de nuevas capacidades. Este aumento de poder se refleja en el nivel de un personaje.",
						"En una partida de Dungeons & Dragons no se gana ni se pierde. O, al menos, no tal y como se entienden estos términos normalmente. El DM y los jugadores crean juntos una emocionante historia, protagonizada por aguerridos aventureros que se enfrentan a peligros mortales. En ocasiones, un personaje podría sufrir un espeluznante final, despedazado por feroces monstruos o liquidado por un perverso villano. Aun así, los demás aventureros pueden buscar una magia lo bastante poderosa como para resucitar a su compañero caído, o tal vez el jugador decida jugar con un personaje nuevo. Es posible que el grupo fracase en su intento de terminar una aventura con éxito, pero si os lo habéis pasado bien y habéis creado una historia memorable, todos habréis ganado.",

								"Los mundos de Dungeons & Dragons existen como parte de un vasto cosmos llamado el multiverso. Están conectados entre sí y con otros planos de existencia, como el Plano Elemental del Fuego y las Profundidades Infinitas del Abismo, de formas extrañas y misteriosas.",
								"Dentro de este multiverso hay una variedad infinita de mundos, muchos de los cuales han sido publicados como ambientaciones oficiales de D&D. Las leyendas de ambientaciones como los Reinos Olvidados, Dragonlance, Falcongris, Sol Oscuro, Mystara y Eberron están entretejidas en la estructura del multiverso. Junto a estos mundos se hallan cientos de miles más; los creados por generaciones de jugadores de D&D para sus propias partidas. Además, podrás añadir un mundo de creación propia a la riqueza del multiverso.",
								"Todos estos mundos comparten ciertas características, pero cada uno se diferencia por su historia y cultura propias, sus monstruos y razas específicos, sus antiguas mazmorras y sus tortuosos villanos. Algunas razas poseen características inusuales en ciertos mundos. Los medianos de la ambientación del Sol Oscuro, por poner un ejemplo, son caníbales que viven en la selva, mientras que los elfos son nómadas del desierto. Unos mundos cuentan con razas desconocidas en otras ambientaciones, como los forjados de Eberron; solados creados y dotados de vida para luchar en la Última Guerra. En cambio, otros están dominados por una única historia fundamental, como la Guerra de la Lanza, el centro de la ambientación Dragonlance. Sin embargo, todos ellos son mundos de D&D, por lo que puedes usar las reglas de este libro para crear un personaje y jugar en cualquiera de ellos.",
								"Tu DM podría situar su campaña en uno de estos mundos o en otro de su propia cosecha. Como existe tanta diversidad entre los mundos de D&D, deberás preguntar a tu Dungeon Master si usaréis alguna regla casera que afecte al juego. Al fin y al cabo, el DM es la autoridad máxima en vuestra campaña y su ambientación, aunque se trate de un mundo publicado."

Muchas de las reglas de la primera parte hacen referencia a las partes segunda y tercera. Si te encuentras con algún término de juego que no entiendes en la primera parte, puedes consultar el índice de términos.",

Esta parte cubre las tiradas de dado que harás para determinar si tu personaje tiene éxito o fracasa en lo que se propone, y describe las tres grandes categorías en las que se pueden clasificar todas las actividades del juego: exploración, interacción y combate.",
								"La {@b tercera parte} (capítulos 10–11) se ocupa de la magia. Explica el funcionamiento de la magia en los mundos de D&D, así como sus reglas, y detalla la enorme variedad de conjuros disponibles para aquellos personajes que pueden utilizar la magia."

								"{@b 1. El DM describe la situación.} El DM explica a los jugadores donde se encuentran sus aventureros y detalla los alrededores, para así darles oportunidad de hacerse una composición de lugar y decidir qué hacer. Un caso concreto podría ser señalar cuántas puertas tiene una habitación, que hay en la mesa, quien está en la taberna, y así.",
								"{@b 2. Los jugadores describen lo que hacen.} A veces un jugador hablará por todo el grupo. Por ejemplo: “Saldremos por la puerta este”. En otras ocasiones, cada aventurero hará una cosa distinta. Así uno podría buscar un cofre mientras otro examina el símbolo esotérico grabado en un muro y un tercero monta guardia para evitar que les sorprendan monstruos. Los jugadores no tienen por qué turnarse, pero el DM debe escucharlos a todos y decidir qué sucede en cada caso.",
								"Muchas veces será fácil determinar qué ocurre. Si un aventurero quiere caminar hasta el otro lado de la habitación y abrir una puerta, el DM simplemente dirá que la puerta se abre y describirá lo que hay tras ella. No obstante, quizá la puerta está cerrada, el suelo esconde una trampa mortal o cualquier otra circunstancia haga que llevar acá o se proponía sea difícil. En estos casos, el DM decidirá lo que sucede, recurriendo habitualmente a la tirada de un dado para dilucidar el resultado de la acción.",

								"En situaciones concretas, en especial el combate, las acciones están más estructuradas y los jugadores (y el DM) se turnan para elegir acciones y resolverlas. Pero la mayor parte del tiempo la forma de jugar será flexible, adaptándose a las circunstancias de la aventura.",
								"En muchas ocasiones las acciones se desarrollan únicamente en la imaginación, tanto de los jugadores como del DM, apoyándose en las descripciones de la escena que hace este. A algunos Dungeon Master les gusta recurrir a música, ilustraciones o efectos de sonido para crear ambiente, y hay tanto jugadores como DM que usan diferentes tonos de voz al hablar para distinguir entre varios aventureros, monstruos y otros personajes que interpreten durante la partida. En ocasiones concretas, el DM podría incluso desplegar un mapa y utilizar contadores o miniaturas para representar a las criaturas que forman parte de una escena, de modo que los jugadores puedan ubicarse más fácilmente.",

										"En este libro nos referiremos a cada uno de los dados escribiendo la letra d seguida del número de caras: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 y d20. Por ejemplo, 1d6 es un dado de seis caras (el cubo que usan la mayoría de los juegos).",
										"Los dados percentiles, o d100, funcionan de forma ligeramente distinta. Para generar un número entre 1 y 100 tiras dos dados de diez caras (numeradas del 0 al 9) distintos.",
										"Uno de ellos (elegido antes de tirar) representará las decenas, y el otro las unidades. De este modo, si sacas un 7 y un 1, el resultado será un 71. Dos ceros representan un 100. Algunos dados de diez caras tienen grabadas directamente las decenas (00, 10, 20 y así sucesivamente), lo que hace más fácil distinguir que dado representa cada dígito. Usando un dado de este tipo, un 70 y un 1 es un 71, y un 00 y un 0 es un 100.",
										"Siempre que sea necesario hacer una tirada, las reglas te dirán cuántos dados y de qué tipo debes utilizar, además de los modificadores a aplicar. Así, \"3d8 + 5\" significa que debes tirar 3 dados de 8 caras, sumar sus resultados y añadir 5 al total.",
										"La misma notación basada en la d se utiliza en expresiones como \"1d3\" y \"1d2\". Para simular la tirada de 1d3, tira 1d6 y divide el resultado entre 2, redondeando hacia arriba. Para la tirada de 1d2, lanza cualquier dado; si sale impar el resultado será 1, y si sale par 2. O, si lo prefieres, si el resultado de la tirada es superior a la mitad del número de caras del dado, entonces el resultado será 2, y 1 en caso contrario."

En aquellas situaciones en las que el resultado de la acción no esté claro, en Dungeons & Dragons se tirará un dado de 20 caras, 1d20, para determinar si esta tiene éxito o fracasa.",

Consulta el capítulo 1 para aprender en que consiste cada característica y cómo determinar el modificador por característica.",

								"En las partidas de Dungeons & Dragons, un grupo de aventureros se embarca en una aventura que el Dungeon Master les presenta. Todos los personajes aportan una serie de capacidades a su grupo en forma de características y habilidades, rasgos de clase, atributos raciales, equipo y objetos mágicos. Cada uno es distinto a las demás, con sus fortalezas y debilidades, por lo que los mejores grupos de aventureros son aquellos en las que los personajes se complementan unos a otros y compensan las debilidades de sus compañeros. Los jugadores deben cooperar para completar con éxito la aventura.",
								"La aventura es el corazón del juego, una historia con un comienzo, un desarrollo y un final. Puede haber sido creada por el Dungeon Master o comprada en una tienda para posteriormente ser modificada, con el fin de adaptarse a las necesidades y deseos del DM. Sea como fuere, toda aventura se desarrolla en una ambientación fantástica como una mazmorra subterránea, un castillo derruido, la naturaleza o la bulliciosa ciudad. En ella aparece un rico elenco de personajes: los aventureros creados y controlados por el resto de los jugadores y los personajes no jugadores (PNJ). Estos últimos pueden ser patrones, aliados, enemigos, siervos o simplemente extras para dar color a la aventura. Muchas veces, uno de estos PNJ será el villano cuyos planes son la causa de la aventura.",
								"A lo largo de sus aventuras, los personajes se enfrentarán a una gran variedad de criaturas, objetos y situaciones, con las que deberán lidiar de una forma u otra. En ocasiones, los aventureros y sus enemigos harán lo posible por matarse o capturar a sus oponentes. No obstante, a veces deberán dialogar con criaturas (o incluso objetos mágicos) para alcanzar sus objetivos. También habrá momentos en los que los personajes deberán resolver un acertijo, superar un obstáculo, encontrar un objeto escondido o percatarse de lo que está ocurriendo en realidad. Y, mientras sucede todo esto, los aventureros explorarán el mundo, decidiendo el destino de sus viajes y que hacer a continuación.",
								"Las aventuras pueden variar en duración y complejidad. Una que fuera corta podría suponer sólo unos pocos desafíos y jugarse en una sola sesión. Por otra parte, una aventura muy larga podría implicar cientos de combates, interacciones y otros retos, así como requerir docenas de sesiones de juego para poder terminarse, haciendo necesarias semanas o incluso meses de tiempo real. Lo más habitual es que el final de una aventura venga marcado por la vuelta a la civilización de los aventureros, que podrán descansar y disfrutar del duramente ganado botín.",
								"Sin embargo, este no es el final de la historia. Podemos entender una aventura como un capítulo (compuesto de escenas) de una serie de televisión.

La exploración es un ciclo continuo en el que los jugadores describen lo que quieren que hagan sus personajes y el Dungeon Master les dice lo que sucede como consecuencia de dichas acciones.",

Ejemplos de estas interacciones podrían ser: interrogar a un explorador capturado para que revele la ubicación de la entrada secreta a la guarida goblin, obtener información de un prisionero rescatado, suplicar misericordia a un caudillo orco o persuadir a un espejo mágico parlanchín para que muestra una localización remota.",

El combate es la parte más fuertemente estructurada de una sesión de D&D y en él las criaturas se turnan para que así todos tengan la oportunidad de actuar. No obstante, incluso en media de una encarnizada batalla, aún hay espacio para que los aventureros intenten las proezas más alocadas que se les ocurran (como bajar surfeando sobre un escudo un tramo de escaleras), examinar su entorno (quizá tirando de esa misteriosa palanca) o interaccionar con otras criaturas, ya sean aliados, enemigos u observadores neutrales."

Sin el impresionante poder mágico y la versatilidad de los magos y los druidas, las amenazas serían diez veces más mortales.",

El líder de una secta que busca despertar a un dios que duerme bajo las aguas, la bruja que secuestra a jóvenes para robarles su vigor, el mago enloquecido que persigue dotar a un ejército de autómatas de una mera semblanza de vida y el dragón que se encuentra tras un ritual que le permitirá convertirse en un dios de la destrucción son solo algunos ejemplos de las amenazas de naturaleza mágica a las que podrían enfrentarse los aventureros. ¡Pero armadas con sus propios poderes mágicos en forma de conjuros y objetos mágicos, los personajes tienen la oportunidad de vencer!"

						"El primer paso para poder jugar a Dungeons & Dragons es imaginar y crear a tu propio personaje. Dicho personaje es una combinación de números, ganchos de interpretación y tu imaginación. Escoge una raza (como humano o mediano) y una clase (como guerrero o mago). También deberás inventar una la personalidad, apariencia e historia pasada de tu personaje. Una vez esté terminado, este será tu representante en el juego, tu avatar en el mundo de Dungeons & Dragons.",
						"Antes de empezar con el punto 1, que aparece más adelante, piensa en el tipo de aventurero con el que quieres jugar. Podrás ser un guerrero valiente, un pícaro sigiloso, un clérigo ferviente o un rango extravagante. O quizá estés más interesado en un personaje poco convencional, como un pícaro pendenciero que disfruta del cuerpo a cuerpo o un francotirador que elimina a sus enemigos desde la distancia. ¿Te gustan las historias de fantasía con elfos o enanos? Puedes probar a hacer un personaje de una de esas razas. ¿Quieres que tu personaje sea el aventurero más duro de la mesa? Valora la posibilidad de crear un bárbaro o un paladín. Si no sabes por dónde empezar, echa un vistazo a las ilustraciones de este libro hasta que encuentres algo que te llame la atención.",
						"Cuando tengas un personaje en mente, procede según los siguientes pasos, tomando las decisiones que mejor representen el aventurero que quieres. Tu concepto de personaje podría evolucionar con cada elección que hagas. Lo importante es que llegues a la mesa con un aventurero con el que te ilusione jugar.",
						"A lo largo de este capítulo usamos el término {@b hoja de personaje} para referirnos a cualquier sistema que utilices para registrar la información de tu personaje, ya sea una hoja de personaje propiamente dicha (como la que aparece al final de este libro), un archivo digital o simplemente una hoja de cuaderno. La hoja de personaje oficial de D&D es un buen punto de partida hasta que sepas que información necesitas durante el juego y como le das uso.",

El capítulo 2 contiene más información sobre estas razas.",
								"La raza que escojas será muy importante a la hora de definir la identidad de tu aventurero, ya que determina su apariencia general y los talentos naturales heredados de su cultura y linaje. La raza de tu personaje le proporciona una serie de atributos raciales, tales como sentidos especiales, competencia con ciertas armas o herramientas, competencia con una o más habilidades, o la capacidad de usar conjuros menores. A veces estos atributos se compenetran bien con las capacidades de ciertas clases (ver el paso 2). Por ejemplo, los atributos raciales de los medianos pies ligeros les convierten en pícaros excepcionales y los altos elfos tienden a ser magos poderosos. Aunque jugar desafiando los arquetipos también puede ser divertido. Los paladines semiorcos y los magos enanos de las montañas, por ejemplo, suelen ser personajes inusuales pero memorables.",

Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased \"I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.\"Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, might have led a life more like the heroic drow's. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin\u2014he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as \"I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do'Urden.\"Each of these characters also has an important flaw.

The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.",
