				"If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.",
				"As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the target's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.",

The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action\u2014knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it\u2014by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.

				"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.",
